## Motivation
In today’s fast-paced world, where convenience often takes precedence over
health and financial considerations, the habit of cooking at home has been
gradually eroding. The convenience of ordering food from outside restaurants
or opting for ready-made meals has become the norm, leading to several con-
cerning issues. To address these concerns, we have undertaken the development
of a software project, ”KHABO” aimed at promoting and facilitating home
cooking. Our motivation behind this project can be succinctly summarized in
the following key points:
- Health and Hygiene Concerns
- Economic Benefits
- Culinary Exploration and Creativity
- Sustainable Living
- Ingredient Sourcing Efficiency
